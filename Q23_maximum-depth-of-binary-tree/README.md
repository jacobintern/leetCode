# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree(Easy)

## Beginners Guide

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example 1

```go=
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2

```go=
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

### Example 3

```go=
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

### Example 4

```go=
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

### Rules

* $The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4]$.
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
