## Beginners Guide

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
---
```go=
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
---
```go=
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

Rules:
---
* $1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4$
* s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
