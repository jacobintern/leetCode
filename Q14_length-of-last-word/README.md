# Length of Last Word(easy)

## Beginners Guide

Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1

```go=
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

Example 2:

---

```go=
Input: s = " "
Output: 0
```

---

### Rules

* $1 <= s.length <= 10^4$
* s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
