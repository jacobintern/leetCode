## Beginners Guide

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
---
```go=
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

Example 2:
---
```go=
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

Rules:
---
* 0 <= s.length <= 1000
* t.length == s.length + 1
* s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
