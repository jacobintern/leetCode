# Binary Tree Onorder Traversal(Easy)

## Beginners Guide

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Example 1

```go=
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

### Example 2

```go=
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Example 3

```go=
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Rules

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
