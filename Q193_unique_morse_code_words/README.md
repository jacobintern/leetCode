## Beginners Guide

International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:

* `'a'` maps to `".-"`,
* `'b'` maps to `"-..."`,
* `'c'` maps to `"-.-."`, and so on.
For convenience, the full table for the `26` letters of the English alphabet is given below:

> [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
Given an array of strings `words` where each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.

* For example, `"cab"` can be written as `"-.-..--..."`, which is the concatenation of `"-.-."`, `".-"`, and `"-..."`. We will call such a concatenation the transformation of a word.
Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.
