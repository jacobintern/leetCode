# Reverse Words in a String III(Easy)

## Beginners Guide

Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"

```

Example 2:

* `s` contains printable ASCII characters.
* `s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
* There is at least one word in `s`.
* All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.
